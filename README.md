# Identify Customer Segments Project

The project uses unsupervised clustering techniques to uncover a customer population with specific characteristics compared to a general population. The project comes from the Data Science Nanodegree program from [Udacity](www.udacity.com). The data comes from Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution, it is proprietary and unavailable. 

The notebook is meant to showcase learned techniques including:
1. Data Preprocessing: Dealing with missing values and feature engineering.
2. Feature Transformation: Using principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction
3. Clustering: Using K means clustering on PCA-transformed data.
4. Analysis: Comparing a larger general population to a customer population and drawing conclusions about the characteristics of the customer population.
